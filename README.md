# itschool-news
This is my final React project from my web development course @ IT School

I create this news application with create-react-app. The app contains news about technology, fotball, fashion and movies. About the structure, it has api, components, pages, store/Favorites, utils, app.js, index.js, index.css, public.
I took datas for this application from THE GUARDIAN API, and i used two options: content and singleItem.
The project contains, too, a global state and so i implemented how to add/delete a favorite news.

## Demo
The project is deployed here: https://itschool-news.netlify.app/
